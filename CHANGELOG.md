The `databrickslabs/sandbox` package is used for building and testing the project.
* Updating `make_schema` fixture to include location to create managed schema ([#66](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/66)). In this update, the `make_schema` fixture has been enhanced to include an optional `location` parameter, enabling users to specify the location for creating a managed schema. This change addresses issue [#6](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/6)
* [chore] update acceptance.yml and remove circular downstreads. In this release, the `acceptance.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory has been updated to use the `acceptance/v0.3.1` Docker image for the `Run integration tests` job, replacing the previous `acceptance/v0.2.2` version. This change ensures that the latest version of the integration tests are being run, which may include bug fixes, new features, and other improvements. The `timeout` parameter has been removed from the job, which may result in longer test execution times but ensures that the tests have enough time to complete. Additionally, the `ARM_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` secrets are now passed as environment variables to the job. The `downstreams.yml` file has also been updated to remove circular dependencies and streamline the build process, while maintaining the use of the `ubuntu-latest` runtime and `fail-fast` option. The `Run nightly tests` job has been updated to use the `acceptance/v0.3.1` Docker image, which may improve test execution during the nightly build due to potential bug fixes, new functionality, or better handling of timeout scenarios. The `create_issues` parameter remains set to true, ensuring that any test failures will result in the creation of GitHub issues to track them. These changes aim to improve the reliability and efficiency of the build and test processes.

Dependency updates:

 * Updated databrickslabs/sandbox requirement to acceptance/v0.3.1 ([#64](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/pull/64)).

## 0.3.0

* Documentation: fix `make_query()` parameter name ([#61](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/61)). The `make_query()` fixture's documentation has been updated to correct the name of the `query` parameter to `sql_query`. The `sql_query` parameter is used to specify the SQL query stored in the fixture, with the default value being "SELECT \* FROM <newly created random table>". This change aims to enhance clarity and consistency in the naming of the argument, making it easier for users of the `make_query()` fixture to comprehend its purpose and usage. By correcting the parameter name, the documentation provides a clearer and more consistent user experience.
* Removed references to UCX ([#56](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/56)). This release includes changes to remove references to UCX in fixture names and descriptions within the testing process. The `create` function in `catalog.py` now appends a random string to "dummy_t", "dummy_s", or `dummy_c` for table, schema, and catalog names, respectively, instead of using "ucx_t", "ucx_S", and "ucx_C". The `test_catalog_fixture` function has also been updated to replace `dummy` with `dummy_c` and `dummy_s` for catalogs and schemas. Additionally, the description of a test query in `redash.py` has been updated to remove the reference to UCX. Lastly, fixture names in the unit tests for a catalog have been updated to use `dummy` instead of "ucx". These changes improve the independence of the testing process by removing technology-specific references, without affecting functionality.
* Store watchdog tags in storage credentials comment ([#57](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/57)). In this release, the watchdog's behavior has been modified to retain properly tagged credentials when deleting them, as previously all credentials were removed without discrimination. This change introduces tagging for preserving specific credentials, and the `watchdog_remove_after` fixture has been added to the README file for documentation. The `make_storage_credential` fixture has been updated to include a new parameter, `watchdog_remove_after`, which specifies the time at which the storage credential should be removed by the watchdog. The `create` function has been updated to accept this parameter and adds it as a comment to the storage credential. The `remove` function remains unmodified. The related fixtures section has been updated to include the new `watchdog_remove_after` fixture. This change was co-authored by Eric Vergnaud, but please note that it has not been tested yet.
* [FEATURE] Extend `make_job` to run `SparkPythonTask` ([#60](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/60)). The `make_job` fixture has been extended to support running `SparkPythonTask` in addition to notebook tasks. A new `make_workspace_file` fixture has been added to create and manage Python files in the workspace. The `make_job` fixture now supports SQL notebooks and files and includes a `task_type` parameter to specify the type of task to run and an `instance_pool_id` parameter to reuse an instance pool for faster job execution during integration tests. Additionally, unit and integration tests have been added to ensure the proper functioning of the new and modified fixtures. These changes allow for more flexible and efficient testing of Databricks jobs with different task types and configurations. The `make_notebook` fixture has also been updated to accept a `content` parameter for creating notebooks with custom content. The `Language` enum from the `databricks.sdk.service.workspace` module is used to specify the language of a notebook or workspace file.


## 0.2.4

* Fixed PyPI metadata ([#54](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/54)). In this commit, the PyPI metadata for the pytester project has been updated with the new repository location at <https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester>. The URLs for issues and source have been changed to point to the new repository, with the `issues` URL now directing to <https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues> and the `source` URL to <https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester>. Furthermore, the versioning tool `hatch` has been configured to manage the version number in the "src/databricks/labs/pytester/__about__.py" file. This ensures accurate and consistent versioning for the pytester project moving forward.
* Improve `make_group`/`make_acc_group` fixture consistency ([#50](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/50)). This PR introduces improvements to the `make_group` and `make_acc_group` fixtures, designed for managing Databricks workspace groups. The enhancements include a double-check approach to ensure group visibility by requiring the group to be retrievable via both `.get()` and `.list()` calls. This mitigates, but does not entirely eliminate, consistency issues with the APIs used for managing groups. The `wait_for_provisioning` argument has been removed and replaced with an internal wait mechanism. The argument is still accepted but triggers a deprecation warning. Internal unit-test plumbing has been updated to use mock fixtures tailored for each test, ensuring double-check implementation testability. New and updated unit tests are included in the `test_iam.py` file, along with the introduction of the `_setup_groups_api` function, which mocks specific clients to ensure group visibility when created. These changes improve consistency and reliability when working with Databricks workspace groups, making it easier for users to adopt the project.


## 0.2.3

* Support providing name in `make_catalog` fixture ([#52](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/52)). The `make_catalog` fixture in our open-source library has been updated to allow users to specify a name for the catalog using a new `name` parameter. Previously, the catalog was given a random name, but now users can have more control and customization over catalog names in their tests. This change includes updates to the docstring and the addition of unit tests to ensure the fixture behaves as expected with the new parameter. Additionally, the underlying `call_stateful` function was updated to expect a callable that returns a generator of callables, enabling the support for providing a name. The `test_make_catalog_creates_catalog_with_name` and `test_make_catalog` tests have been added to verify the behavior of the fixture with the new `name` parameter.


## 0.2.2

* Use watchdog timeout to catalog properties ([#48](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/48)). This pull request introduces a new `RemoveAfter` property for catalogs, which allows for marking them for skipping by the watchdog. This change addresses the current implementation gap, which does not explicitly indicate when catalogs are being used. The new property will specify the time from which objects can be purged. A corresponding fixture `watchdog_remove_after` has been added to the list of available fixtures, and the `make_catalog` fixture has been updated to include this new property. Additionally, a timeout mechanism for catalogs has been implemented, which improves the system's efficiency and safety by marking catalogs as in use. A test for the `make_catalog` function has been included to ensure that the `RemoveAfter` entry is correctly added to the catalog properties. However, the specific call parameters for the `catalogs.create` method cannot be accurately determined in the test.
* use tags instead of name suffix for queries ([#47](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/47)). This release introduces updates to the testing library for Databricks, enhancing the naming conventions for queries to improve readability and comprehension. The previous implementation used name suffixes, which have been replaced with watchdog query tags. The `watchdog_purge_suffix` fixture has been renamed to `watchdog_remove_after`, and the new `make_query` fixture has been added to the documentation. In addition, the `make_query` and `create` functions now accept an optional `tags` argument, and the query name is generated with a unique identifier. If `tags` are provided, the `RemoveAfter` tag is added. The `original_query_tag` is no longer hardcoded in the `create` function and has been removed. These changes improve the overall user experience and maintainability of the project.


## 0.2.1

* Moved remaining UCX integration tests and fixtures ([#45](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/45)). In this release, we have made significant changes to the UCX integration tests and fixtures, as indicated by multiple commit messages. Firstly, we have moved remaining UCX integration tests and fixtures, introducing a new PyTest fixture called `Installation` in the README.md file, providing instructions on how to add `databricks-labs-pytester` as a test-time dependency when using `hatch` as the build system. Additionally, we have added the `make_feature_table` fixture, which creates a Databricks feature table and cleans it up after the test, taking optional parameters for customization. We have also modified the `mypy` configuration in the `pyproject.toml` file to allow untyped imports during the type-checking process. In the `compute.py` file, we have updated the `make_job` fixture to return a function that creates a `databricks.sdk.service.jobs.Job` instance, and modified the `create` function to return the `databricks.sdk.service.jobs.Job` instance directly. We have also added a new fixture called `make_feature_table` in the plugin file, which simulates the lifecycle of a feature table in the machine learning service, with functions to generate a unique name and create/remove the feature table. In the `test_catalog.py` file, we have made changes to clean up the file and ensure proper logging of test events and errors. Overall, these changes aim to refactor, expand functionality, and improve user-friendliness for the adopters of the project, ensuring proper logging and debugging capabilities.
* [internal] port over existing UCX integration tests ([#44](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/44)). Three new integration tests have been added to the UCX project to verify the functionality of the `RemoveAfter` property for tables and schemas. The `test_remove_after_property_table` and `test_remove_after_property_schema` tests create new tables and schemas, respectively, and check if the `RemoveAfter` property is included in their properties. However, these tests are still marked as `TODO` due to existing issues with the `tables.get` and `schemas.get` functions. In addition, existing UCX integration tests have been ported over, which include new functions for testing the removal of resources based on the `RemoveAfter` tag. These tests are located in the `tests/integration/fixtures/test_compute.py` file and test the removal of various types of resources, including jobs, clusters, warehouses, and instance pools. The tests ensure that the time until purge is less than the `TEST_RESOURCE_PURGE_TIMEOUT` value plus one hour and import the `datetime` module and the `TEST_RESOURCE_PURGE_TIMEOUT` constant from the `watchdog` fixture, as well as the `logging` and `databricks.sdk.service.iam` modules.


## 0.2.0

* Added `acc` and `make_acc_group` fixtures ([#42](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/42)). In this release, we have added two new fixtures, `acc` and `make_acc_group`, to the open-source library. The `acc` fixture provides a Databricks AccountClient object for use in tests, which can interact with the Databricks account API and automatically determines the account host from the `DATABRICKS_HOST` environment variable. The `make_acc_group` fixture is used for managing Databricks account groups, creating them with specified members and roles, and automatically deleting them after the test is complete. This fixture mirrors the behavior of the `make_group` fixture but interacts with the account client instead of the workspace client. These fixtures enable more comprehensive integration tests for the `acc` object and its various methods, enhancing the testing and management of Databricks account groups.


## 0.1.1

* Fixed nightly CI builds ([#40](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/40)). In this release, we have removed the `no-cheat` GitHub Actions workflow that checked for disables pylint directives in new code. We have also updated the pytest requirement version to ~8.3.3 and added badges for Python version support and lines of code to the README file. The `permissions.py` file in the `databricks/labs/pytester/fixtures` directory has been updated to fix nightly CI builds by improving import statements and updating types. The `SqlPermissionLevel` class has been imported from the `databricks.sdk.service.sql` module, and an existing test case has been updated to use this new permission level for SQL-specific queries. Additionally, we have updated the version constraints for three dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file to allow for more flexibility in selecting compatible library versions. These changes may simplify the project's GitHub Actions workflows, reduce maintenance overhead, and enhance the testing process and code quality.


## 0.1.0

* Added Databricks Connect fixture. A new fixture named `spark` has been added to the codebase, providing a Databricks Connect Spark session for testing purposes. The fixture requires the `databricks-connect` package to be installed and takes a `WorkspaceClient` object as an argument. It first checks if a `cluster_id` is present in the environment, and if not, it skips the test and raises a message. The fixture then ensures that the cluster is running and attempts to import the `DatabricksSession` class from the `databricks.connect` module. If the import fails, it skips the test and raises a message. This new fixture enables easier testing of Databricks Connect functionality, reducing boilerplate code required to set up a Spark session within tests. Additionally, a new `is_in_debug` fixture has been added, although there is no further documentation or usage examples provided for it.
* Added `make_*_permissions` fixtures. In this release, we have added new fixtures to the pytester plugin for managing permissions in Databricks. These fixtures include `make_alert_permissions`, `make_authorization_permissions`, `make_cluster_permissions`, `make_cluster_policy_permissions`, `make_dashboard_permissions`, `make_directory_permissions`, `make_instance_pool_permissions`, `make_job_permissions`, `make_notebook_permissions`, `make_pipeline_permissions`, `make_query_permissions`, `make_registered_model_permissions`, `make_repository_permissions`, `make_serving_endpoint_permissions`, `make_warehouse_permissions`, `make_workspace_file_permissions`, and `make_workspace_file_path_permissions`. These fixtures allow for easier testing of functionality that requires managing permissions in Databricks, and are used for managing permissions for various Databricks resources such as alerts, authorization, clusters, cluster policies, dashboards, directories, instance pools, jobs, notebooks, pipelines, queries, registered models, repositories, serving endpoints, warehouses, and workspace files. Additionally, a new `make_notebook_permissions` fixture has been introduced in the `test_permissions.py` file for integration tests, which allows for more comprehensive testing of the IAM system's behavior when handling notebook permissions.
* Added `make_catalog` fixture. A new fixture, `make_catalog`, has been added to the codebase to facilitate testing with specific catalogs, ensuring isolation and reproducibility. This fixture creates a catalog, returns its information, and removes the catalog after the test is complete. It can be used in conjunction with other fixtures such as `ws`, `sql_backend`, and `make_random`. The fixture is utilized in the updated `test_catalog_fixture` integration test function, which now includes new arguments `make_catalog`, `make_schema`, and `make_table`. These fixtures create catalog, schema, and table objects, enabling more comprehensive testing of the catalog, schema, and table creation functionality. Please note that catalogs created using this fixture are not currently protected from being deleted by the watchdog.
* Added `make_catalog`, `make_schema`, and `make_table` fixtures ([#33](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/33)). In this release, we have updated the `databricks-labs-blueprint` package dependency to `databricks-labs-lsql~=0.10` and added several fixtures to the codebase to improve the reliability and maintainability of the test suite. We have introduced three new fixtures `make_catalog`, `make_schema`, and `make_table` that are used for creating and managing test catalogs, schemas, and tables, respectively. These fixtures enable the creation of arbitrary test data and simplify testing by allowing predictable and consistent setup and teardown of test data for integration tests. Additionally, we have added several debugging fixtures, including `debug_env_name`, `debug_env`, `env_or_skip`, and `sql_backend`, to aid in testing DataBricks features related to SQL, environments, and more. The `make_udf` fixture has also been added for testing user-defined functions in DataBricks. These new fixtures and methods will assist in testing the project's functionality and ensure that the code is working as intended, making the tests more maintainable and easier to understand.
* Added `make_cluster` documentation. The `make_cluster` fixture has been updated with new functionality and improvements. It now creates a Databricks cluster with specified configurations, waits for it to start, and cleans it up after the test, returning a function to create clusters. The `cluster_id` attribute is accessible from the returned object. The fixture accepts several keyword arguments: `single_node` to create a single-node cluster, `cluster_name` to specify a cluster name, `spark_version` to set the Spark version, and `autotermination_minutes` to determine when the cluster should be automatically terminated. The `ws` and `make_random` parameters have been removed. The commit also introduces a new test function, `test_cluster`, that creates a single-node cluster and outputs a message indicating the creation. Documentation for the `make_cluster` function has been added, and the `make_cluster_policy` function remains unchanged.
* Added `make_experiment` fixture. In this release, we introduce the `make_experiment` fixture in the `databricks.labs.pytester.fixtures.ml` module, facilitating the creation and cleanup of Databricks Experiments for testing purposes. This fixture accepts optional `path` and `experiment_name` parameters and returns a `databricks.sdk.service.ml.CreateExperimentResponse` object. Additionally, `make_experiment_permissions` has been added for managing experiment permissions. In the `permissions.py` file, the `_make_permissions_factory` function replaces the previous `_make_redash_permissions_factory`, enhancing the code's maintainability and extensibility. Furthermore, a `make_experiment` fixture has been added to the `plugin.py` file for creating experiments with custom names and descriptions. Lastly, a `test_experiments` function has been included in the `tests/integration/fixtures` directory, utilizing `make_group`, `make_experiment`, and `make_experiment_permissions` fixtures to create experiments and assign group permissions.
* Added `make_instance_pool` documentation. In this release, the `make_instance_pool` fixture has been updated with added documentation, and the usage example has been slightly modified. The fixture now accepts optional keyword arguments for the instance pool name and node type ID, with default values set for each. The `make_random` fixture is still required for generating unique names. Additionally, a new function, `log_workspace_link`, has been updated to accept a new parameter `anchor` for controlling the inclusion of an anchor (`#`) in the generated URL. New test functions `test_instance_pool` and `test_cluster_policy` have been added to enhance the integration testing of the compute system, providing more comprehensive coverage for instance pools and cluster policies. Furthermore, documentation has been added for the `make_instance_pool` fixture. Lastly, three test functions, `test_cluster`, `test_instance_pool`, and `test_job`, have been removed, but the setup functions for these tests are retained, indicating a possible streamlining of the codebase.
* Added `make_job` documentation. The `make_job` fixture has been updated with additional arguments and improved documentation. It now accepts `notebook_path`, `name`, `spark_conf`, and `libraries` as optional keyword arguments, and can accept any additional arguments to be passed to the `WorkspaceClient.jobs.create` method. If no `notebook_path` or `tasks` argument is provided, a random notebook is created and a single task with a notebook task is run using the latest Spark version and a single worker cluster. The fixture has been improved to manage Databricks jobs and clean them up after testing. Additionally, documentation has been added for the `make_job` function and the `test_job` function in the test fixtures file. The `test_job` function, which created a job and logged its creation, has been removed, and the `test_cluster` and `test_pipeline` functions remain unchanged. The `os` module is no longer imported in this file.
* Added `make_model` fixture. A new pytest fixture, `make_model`, has been added to the codebase for the open-source library. This fixture facilitates the creation and automatic cleanup of Databricks Models during tests, returning a `GetModelResponse` object. The optional `model_name` parameter allows for customization, with a default value of `dummy-*`. The `make_model` fixture can be utilized in conjunction with other fixtures such as `ws`, `make_random`, and `make_registered_model_permissions`, streamlining the testing of model-related functionality. Additionally, a new test function, `test_models`, has been introduced, utilizing `make_model`, `make_group`, and `make_registered_model_permissions` fixtures to test model management within the system. This new feature enhances the library's testing capabilities, making it easier to create, configure, and manage models and related resources during test execution.
* Added `make_pipeline` fixture. A new fixture named `make_pipeline` has been added to the project, which facilitates the creation and cleanup of a Delta Live Tables Pipeline after testing. This fixture is added to the `compute.py` file and takes optional keyword arguments such as `name`, `libraries`, and `clusters`. It generates a random name, creates a disposable notebook with random libraries, and creates a single node cluster with 16GB memory and local disk if these arguments are not provided. The fixture returns a function to create pipelines, resulting in a `CreatePipelineResponse` instance. Additionally, a new integration test has been added to test the functionality of this fixture, and it logs information about the created pipeline for debugging and inspection purposes. This new fixture improves the testing capabilities of the project, allowing for more robust and flexible tests of pipeline creation and management.
* Added `make_query` fixture. In this release, we have added a new fixture called `make_query` to the plugin module for the Redash integration. This fixture creates a `LegacyQuery` object for testing query-related functionality in a controlled environment. It can be used in conjunction with the `make_user` and `make_query_permissions` fixtures to test query permissions for a specific user. The `make_query` fixture generates a random query name, creates a table, and uses the `ws.queries_legacy.create` method to create the query. The query is then deleted using the `ws.queries_legacy.delete` method after the test is completed. This fixture is utilized in the `test_permissions_for_redash` function, which creates a user and a query, and then sets the permission level for the query for the created user using the `make_query_permissions` fixture. This enhancement improves the testing capabilities of the Pytester framework for projects that utilize Redash.
* Added `make_schema` fixture. A new `make_schema` fixture has been added to the open-source library to improve schema management and testing. This fixture creates a schema with an optional catalog name and a schema name, which defaults to a random string. The fixture cleans up the schema after the test is complete and returns an instance of `SchemaInfo`. It can be used in conjunction with other fixtures such as `make_table` and `make_udf` for easier testing and setup of schemas. Additionally, the `make_schema` fixture includes a new keyword-only argument `log_workspace_link` to log a link to the created schema in the Databricks workspace. The `make_catalog` fixture has also been updated to include the `log_workspace_link` argument for logging links to created catalogs. These changes enhance the testability of the code and provide better catalog and schema management in the Databricks workspace.
* Added `make_serving_endpoint` fixture. A new `make_serving_endpoint` fixture has been added to the codebase, located in `baseline.py`, `ml.py`, and `plugin.py` files, and `tests/integration/fixtures/test_ml.py`. This fixture enables the creation and deletion of Databricks Serving Endpoints, handling any potential DatabricksError exceptions during teardown. It also creates a model for a small workload size and returns a `ServingEndpointDetailed` object. The `make_serving_endpoint_permissions` fixture is introduced as well, creating serving endpoint permissions for a specified object ID, permission level, and group name. New tests have been implemented to demonstrate the usage of these fixtures, showing how to create serving endpoints, grant query permissions to a group, and test the endpoint. Additionally, updates have been made to the README.md file to include documentation for the new fixtures.
* Added `make_storage_credential` fixture. In this release, we have added a new fixture called `make_storage_credential` to our testing utilities. This fixture creates a storage credential with configurable parameters such as credential name, Azure service principal information, AWS IAM role ARN, and read-only status. It can be used to create either an Azure or AWS storage credential, depending on the provided parameters, and removes the created credential after the test. This fixture is implemented in `plugin.py` and is added to the existing list of fixtures for consistent and easy-to-use testing setup. Additionally, we have introduced an integration test called `test_storage_credential` in the test catalog for fixtures. This test utilizes the new `make_storage_credential` fixture and verifies the functionality of creating a storage credential and the integration between the system and storage services. These new additions will make it easier to write tests that require access to storage resources and improve the efficiency and ease of testing and developing new features in the codebase.
* Added `make_table` fixture. In this release, we've added the `make_table` fixture to simplify testing operations on tables and catalogs. This fixture creates a table with a given catalog and schema name, CTAS statement, and properties. It can create the table as a non-delta or delta table, external table with CSV or Delta location, or a view, and allows overriding the storage location. Additionally, we've updated the fixture to include new parameters and functionality, such as logging a workspace link for the created table and specifying the catalog and schema where the table will be created. The fixture now also includes new functions for creating and casting columns in the table. After the test, the fixture automatically removes the created table. This release aims to provide a more customizable and convenient way to test table operations.
* Added `make_udf` fixture. The `make_udf` fixture has been added to facilitate the creation and removal of User-Defined Functions (UDFs) for testing purposes. This fixture creates a UDF with optional parameters to specify catalog, schema, name, and Hive UDF creation. It returns an instance of `databricks.sdk.service.catalog.FunctionInfo`. The UDF is removed after the test. This feature is utilized in the new `test_make_some_udfs` integration test, where it creates two UDFs in a schema within the Hive metastore, one with and one without Hive support. Additionally, the `test_create_view` test is now skipped, and the `test_table_fixture` test remains unchanged. This change improves the ability to test UDFs within the Hive metastore, and allows for more comprehensive testing by creating UDFs programmatically.
* Added `make_warehouse` fixture. A new `make_warehouse` fixture has been added to the test suite, which allows for the creation and customization of a Databricks warehouse for testing purposes. The fixture accepts optional keyword arguments such as `warehouse_name`, `warehouse_type`, `cluster_size`, `max_num_clusters`, and `enable_serverless_compute`, allowing users to configure the warehouse's properties. It returns a function that creates a warehouse using the provided parameters and handles cleanup after the test is complete. Additionally, a corresponding test function `test_warehouse_has_remove_after_tag` has been added to verify that a newly created warehouse has the expected `RemoveAfter` tag, facilitating automated testing and resource management. This enhancement expands the testing capabilities of the plugin and provides a more streamlined approach to testing functionality related to Databricks warehouses.
* Added ability to specify custom SQL in `make_query`. The `make_query` fixture has been updated to allow for greater customization in testing, with the addition of a new `query` keyword argument. This parameter enables users to specify a custom SQL query to be stored and executed, with the default value being `SELECT * FROM <newly created random table>`. The fixture continues to create and remove the `LegacyQuery` object, making it user-friendly. With this enhancement, users have increased flexibility to tailor their tests to specific needs, providing more targeted and precise testing outcomes.
* Added documentation for `make_cluster_policy`. In this release, we introduce new features to enhance testing and managing Databricks cluster policies and workspace link logging in your project. We've added the `make_cluster_policy` fixture, which simplifies the creation and deletion of cluster policies using a specified workspace. This fixture returns a `CreatePolicyResponse` instance and can be used within test functions. Additionally, we've developed the `log_workspace_link` fixture, which constructs and logs a workspace link for debugging and tracking purposes. The `make_cluster_policy` function is also introduced in the `plugin.py` file, enabling users to manage and test Databricks cluster policies using the pytester framework. To ensure proper functionality, the `test_compute.py` file includes a test function for `make_cluster_policy`. These improvements will help streamline testing processes and enhance the overall user experience.
* Added documentation for `make_group` and `make_user`. In this release, we have introduced the `make_group` and `make_user` fixtures to manage Databricks workspace groups and users, respectively. The `make_group` fixture allows you to create groups with specified members, roles, and entitlements, handling eventual consistency issues and waiting for group provisioning if required. The `make_user` fixture creates a user and deletes it after the test, handling naming conflicts by retrying the creation process for 30 seconds. Both fixtures return instances of `Group` and `User`, respectively, and have been documented in the README.md with usage examples. Additionally, we have introduced a built-in logger that traces entity creation and deletion through links in the Databricks Workspace UI, and added documentation for the `make_group` and `make_user` functions using the `gen-readme.py` script. The release also includes updates to the `conftest.py` file in the `tests/integration` directory, importing the `fixture` function from `pytest` and the `install_logger` and `logging` modules from `databricks.labs.blueprint.logger` to improve documentation and configure logging for the project.
* Added documentation for `make_notebook`, `make_directory`, and `make_repo`. The `make_notebook`, `make_directory`, and `make_repo` fixtures have been updated with new functionality and improved documentation in this release. These fixtures are used in tests to manage Databricks notebooks, directories, and repos respectively, and they now return functions that create resources with specified parameters. The `make_notebook` fixture now includes optional keyword arguments for `path`, `content`, `language`, `format`, and `overwrite`, and returns an `os.PathLike` object that will be automatically deleted after the test is complete. The `make_directory` fixture now includes an optional keyword argument for `path`, and the `make_repo` fixture now includes optional keyword arguments for `url`, `provider`, and `path`. These fixtures simplify the process of creating and managing Databricks resources in tests and help ensure that resources are properly cleaned up after each test is complete. The commit also includes documentation for the new functionality and integration tests for these fixtures.
* Added documentation for `make_secret_scope` and `make_secret_scope_acl`. In this release, documentation has been added for two new functions, `make_secret_scope` and `make_secret_scope_acl`, which are used for creating and managing secret scopes and their associated access control lists (ACLs) in a Databricks Workspace. The `make_secret_scope` function creates a new secret scope with a unique name generated using a random name generator, and automatically deletes the scope after the test is complete. The `make_secret_scope_acl` function manages ACLs for secret scopes, defining permissions for principals (users or groups) on specific secret scopes. Three new test functions have also been added to test the functionality of creating secret scopes and managing their ACLs using these new functions. Additionally, type hints have been added to the package to support PEP 561. Overall, these changes improve the documentation and testing of the project, making it easier for developers to understand and use these new functions for managing secret scopes and their ACLs in a Databricks Workspace.
* Added documentation update on `make fmt` ([#34](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/34)). In this release, the `make fmt` command in the documentation has been updated to include an additional step that runs the `gen-readme.py` script before executing `hatch run fmt`. This new script generates or updates the README file with detailed documentation on various PyTest fixtures available in the Python Testing for Databricks project. A new `Fixture` dataclass has been introduced to represent a fixture's metadata, and the `databricks.labs.pytester.fixtures.plugin` module is used to discover all fixtures. The `FIXTURES` section in the README.md file has been updated with the new documentation, which includes information on the purpose, parameters, return values, and usage examples for each fixture. The `test` and `lint` targets in the Makefile remain unchanged. Please note that this project is not officially supported by Databricks.
* Added downstream testing. In this enhancement, we have implemented downstream testing in our CI/CD pipeline through the introduction of a new GitHub Actions workflow called "downstreams.yml." This workflow runs tests when pull requests are opened, synchronized, or checked during a merge group, and on pushes to the main branch. The job compatibility is set up to run on the latest version of Ubuntu, and it includes steps to checkout the code with a full fetch depth, install Python, install the toolchain, and run the downstreams test suite using the databrickslabs/sandbox/downstreams action. The downstreams matrix includes the blueprint, lsql, ucx, and remorph repositories in the databrickslabs organization. The GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is used for authentication. This improvement will help ensure that our codebase remains stable and functional as we continue to develop and release new features.
* Added note on UCX project. In the 2024 release, the open-source library has undergone significant updates, incorporating the UCX project into its ecosystem. UCX, an open-source project providing a unified communication layer for various high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, enhances the library's functionality, particularly in automated migrations and static code analysis. The library, developed as part of the Unity Catalog Automated Migrations project, has also added new authors and maintainers, including Vuong Nguyen, Lars George, Cor Zuurmond, Andrew Snare, Pritish Pai, and removed Liran Bareket and Vuong Nguyen, indicating potential new contributions and teams involved. The logging section has also been improved, based on years of debugging integration tests for Databricks and its ecosystem, simplifying integration testing with Databricks for other projects.
* Added support for `.env` files ([#36](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/36)). In this change, we have added support for `.env` files to the open-source library, allowing for local debugging and integration tests in IDEs. A new `debug_env_name` fixture has been introduced, which enables specifying the name of the debug environment with a default value of `.env`. If there are security concerns about using `.env` files, a `~/.databricks/debug-env.json` file can be used instead. Additionally, we have updated the `gen-readme.py` script and the `Fixture` class to improve documentation and provide information about the relationships between fixtures and `.env` files. The `debug_env` fixture has been added to read a `debug-env.json` file if the code is running in debug mode, and the `env_or_skip` fixture has been updated to skip tests if required environment variables are not set. These changes improve the testing capabilities of the library, allowing for easier management and integration of environment variables in tests.
* Added supporting documents. In this release, we introduce a new changelog file for the project, versioned at 0.0.0, to record notable changes over time. Additionally, we have added a CODEOWNERS file, designating @nfx as the default code owner for all files in the repository, and a CONTRIBUTING.md file that provides detailed guidelines for contributing to the project. The CONTRIBUTING.md file covers a wide range of topics, including first principles, change management, code organization, adding new fixtures, common mypy error fixes, integration testing infrastructure, local setup, first contribution, and troubleshooting. These additions aim to improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration for the project's developers and users.
* Added telemetry tracking. A new telemetry tracking feature has been implemented in the project with the addition of the `with_user_agent_extra` method in the "__init__.py" file. This method, sourced from the "databricks.sdk.core" package, enables the attachment of an extra user agent string to HTTP requests, which includes the version of the `pytester` project. The "_about_\.py" file's `__version__` variable is utilized to ensure the specific version of the `pytester` project is incorporated in the user agent string. This enhancement allows for the tracking of project usage and statistics through user agents, providing valuable insights for future development and improvements.
* Added unit testing for test fixtures. In this release, we have added comprehensive unit tests for various entities in our codebase, such as alerts, authorization permissions, catalog, cluster, cluster policies, dashboard permissions, directories, experiments, feature table permissions, groups, instance pools, instance pool permissions, jobs, job permissions, lakeview dashboard permissions, models, notebooks, notebook permissions, pipelines, pipeline permissions, queries, query permissions, registered model permissions, repos, repo permissions, secret scopes, secret scope ACLs, serving endpoints, serving endpoint permissions, storage credentials, UDFs, users, warehouses, warehouse permissions, workspace file path permissions, and workspace file permissions. Additionally, we have updated fixtures such as sql_backend, workspace_library, debug_env, and product_info with tests and provided examples on how to use these fixtures in the code. We have also updated our configuration files to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability, including updating the version of mypy, adding the unit package to the known-first-party modules in isort configuration, and updating the ignore list for pylint. Furthermore, we have added a new `unwrap.py` file to the `databricks/labs/pytester/fixtures` directory to support unit testing of pytest fixtures. We have also added unit tests for test fixtures in various files, ensuring that the fixtures behave as expected, thereby improving the reliability and stability of the codebase. Lastly, we have added a new unit test file for testing catalog functionality, specifically for the `make_table` function, which creates a new managed table with a specified schema and table type.
* Bump unit testing coverage. This commit enhances the unit testing coverage and improves the overall code quality of the open-source library. Several changes have been introduced, including the addition of new fixtures `sql_backend`, `sql_exec`, and `sql_fetch_all` for testing SQL-related functionality in the Databricks platform. These fixtures are demonstrated in the newly added `random_string` test case. The commit also introduces a new section `exclude_also` under the "[tool.mypy]" section in the pyproject.toml file, which provides more precise control over the lines checked during mypy type checking. Furthermore, the environment.py file has been removed, and several SQL backend and test resource purge time-related fixtures have been deleted, resulting in increased unit testing coverage. Additionally, the `catalog.py` and `compute.py` files in the `databricks/labs/pytester/fixtures` directory have been updated to improve resource management and ensure proper handling after tests are executed. The `permissions.py` file has been modified to remove the `sql/` prefix from permission paths for dashboards, alerts, and queries, simplifying the permission hierarchy in the tests. The `plugin.py` file has been updated to reorganize SQL and environment-related functions, making them more modular and maintainable. Finally, new utility fixtures `watchdog_remove_after` and `watchdog_purge_suffix` have been added in the `watchdog.py` file to manage and purge test objects as needed, and a new file, `.env`, has been added to the `tests/unit/fixtures/` directory to provide consistent testing conditions. These changes contribute to a better testing environment and improved overall project quality.
* Prettify fixture documentation ([#35](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/35)). In this release, the documentation of the `ws` fixture in the Databricks testing project has been significantly enhanced in the README file. The `ws` fixture now has more comprehensive documentation, including its purpose, usage example, and the fact that it is built on top of other fixtures. Additionally, the Fixture class in the gen-readme.py script has been improved for better readability and clarity. The `make_random` function in the baseline.py file has been refactored for improved documentation and clarity, with updated usage examples and the removal of a deprecated `Returns` section. These changes aim to provide clearer and more comprehensive documentation for users, making it easier to understand and utilize the features effectively.
* Updated README.md. In this update, we have added several PyTest fixtures to enhance testing capabilities in the Databricks workspace. These fixtures include `make_warehouse_permissions`, `make_lakeview_dashboard_permissions`, `log_workspace_link`, `make_dashboard_permissions`, `make_alert_permissions`, `make_query_permissions`, `make_experiment_permissions`, `make_registered_model_permissions`, `make_serving_endpoint_permissions`, and `make_feature_table_permissions`. These additions enable easier testing of various functionalities and linking within the workspace. Furthermore, we have included the `make_authorization_permissions` fixture to facilitate testing of authorization functionalities. To aid in debugging, we have updated the `Logging` section with the `debug_env_name` and `debug_env` fixtures. Lastly, we have added the `workspace_library` fixture for testing library-related functionalities in the workspace. These changes improve the overall testing experience and enable more comprehensive testing within the Databricks workspace.
* Updated pytest requirement from ~=8.1.0 to ~=8.3.3 ([#31](https://github.com/databrickslabs/pytester/issues/31)). In this pull request, we update the pytest requirement from version 8.1.0 to 8.3.3 in our pyproject.toml file. This update includes several bug fixes and improvements for our testing framework, such as avoiding the calling of properties during fixture discovery, fixing the issue of not displaying assertion failure differences with the `--import-mode=importlib` option in pytest 8.1 and above, and addressing a regression that caused mypy to fail. Additionally, we fix typing compatibility with Python 3.9 or less by replacing `typing.Self` with `typing_extensions.Self`. This update also ensures consistent path handling across environments by fixing an issue with backslashes being incorrectly converted in nodeid paths on Windows.
